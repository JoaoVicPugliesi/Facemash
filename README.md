### Facemash - Backend

Here is my backend where i cover all possible useCases and apply clean architecture to make it the most original possible. As like in the movie i used the elo rating system... i'm not so good at math thinking, but in this case it was exciting and also inspiring.

Ps. I have not applied TDD here, small commits, factories, decorators and also the image approach i chose seems a little rust. So, there are gaps that must be filled someday ahead.
